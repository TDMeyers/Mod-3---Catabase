Cat-A-Base LIVE HERE AT --- https://cat-a-base.onrender.com/cats

A MERN stack based website focused on cats, cats, cats. It is connected with The Cats Api to import a variety of pictures and lots of information about various breeds. 
The goal with development was to have a suitably comprehensive database of information that users could look through. Users can make an account and save favorites to their profile to view later. 
An extended goal is to future utilize the MERN stack and allow for multiple-user interaction by allowing for comments to be tagged by both user, location, and breed.

Unsolved Problems

The Cat Api occasionally returns a 429 error when fetching pictures for the main scroll feed. It throws an error in the console feed but doesn't always seem to produce an error on the user's end. 
Sometimes it does duplicate pictures in the cards for the various items while mapping over the results. 

When trying to send a post request on the user's profile page sometimes it correctly sends the headers with the _id key passed through and sometimes it sends the body information as a URL query. 


Future Enhancements

Allowing multiple users to comment on one breed
Linking each breed card to a page with full information from the API 
Correcting the post request from profile when updating 
allowing for upload of pictures from users for cats and profile picture 

Identify future features and enhancements planned for the project.
